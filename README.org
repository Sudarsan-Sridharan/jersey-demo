* Using Jersey in Apache Karaf

This is a small apache karaf demo application that demonstrates how to use Jersey in Apache Karaf, and how to inject OSGi services into Jersey resources.

** The structure of the Demo

The demo consists of the following maven artifacts:
 1. jerseyinkaraf.servicedef which is an OSGi bundle containing interfaces and beans defining the available OSGi services
 2. jerseinkaraf.services which is an OSGi bundle containing implementations of the services
 3. jerseyinkaraf.webapi which is an OSGi bundle that defines a REST API that plugs into the Web Whiteboard Extender and exposes the OSGi services
 4. jerseyikaraf.webgui which is an OSGi bundle that exposes a small react.js application that plugs into the Web Whiteboard Extender
 5. karaf is a karaf feature repository that can be used to load the web application in karaf

** How to install

This is how to build and install the servlet:
 1. First [[https://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/quick-start.html#_quick_start][download and install apache karaf]]
 2. In the apache karaf command line, install the features that pulls in the servlets with their dependencies
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      feature:repo-add mvn:no.priv.bang.demos.jerseyinkaraf/jersey-demo/LATEST/xml/features
      feature:install webapi
      feature:install webgui
    #+END_EXAMPLE
 3. After this, the servlet will be listening for POST requests, at the local path "/overlaptest/api/testservice" on the karaf web server, e.g. http://localhost:8181/overlaptest for a karaf server started locally, with default settings

** To uninstall the counter servlet from karaf

This is how to uninstall the servlet from karaf:
 1. At the karaf console prompt, give the following command:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      feature:uninstall webapi
    #+END_EXAMPLE

This will cause repeated clicks on the "Increment" button to result in 405 responses, because the webgui servlet now intercepts the requests, but that servlet doesn't support the POST requests used to increment the counter.

Reinstalling the webapi feature will cause the count to start again from 0.
